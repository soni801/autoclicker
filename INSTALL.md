# Installation

Soni's Autoclicker comes as a native image. This makes using it a very easy and likely familiar process. The
installation procedure for your operating system is as follows:

### Windows:

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/soni801/autoclicker/releases).
2. Download and unzip the Windows build from the latest release.
3. Launch the `Soni's Autoclicker.exe` file. The autoclicker will now launch.

_**Disclaimer**_: Make sure to not move the `.exe` file away from the folder. If you want to move it somewhere else
(e.g. your desktop), right click it and select _Send to > Desktop (create shortcut)_.

### Linux:

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/soni801/autoclicker/releases).
2. Download and unzip the Linux build from the latest release.
3. Open your terminal, and make the `bin/Soni's Autoclicker` file executable by running `chmod +x path/to/binary`.
4. Execute it by running `./Soni's Autoclicker` in the `bin/` directory.

_**Disclaimer**_: Due to the massive difference between individual distributions and themes, the autoclicker cannot be
perfected for all environments. I can not guarantee that the autoclicker will look good in your case.

### macOS:

1. Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/soni801/autoclicker/releases).
2. Download and unzip the macOS build from the latest release.
3. Launch the `Soni's Autoclicker` executable. This file can be moved anywhere on your system if you want to. It is,
however, recommended placing it in your `Applications` folder.

_**Disclaimer**_: Depending on your configuration, you may get a popup saying Apple can't trust the software. In this
case, go to your system preferences and allow the application. The popup should contain instructions on how to do this.

**Regarding macOS**: I can not guarantee to maintain the macOS binary. Apple has gone out of their way to make it
difficult to automate deployment on their platforms from other systems. There is a high possibility that releases do not
contain a macOS binary, especially smaller releases. If you want a macOS binary for a release that doesn't have one,
consider cloning the repository and building it yourself.
