## Reporting a Vulnerability

Given how lightweight the application is, the chance of there being a vulnerability is low. If you still think you have
discovered a vulnerability, please create an [issue](https://github.com/soni801/autoclicker/issues/new/choose).
Vulnerability fixes will be released when needed.
