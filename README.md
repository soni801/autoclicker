# Soni's Autoclicker

The (soon to be) most advanced autoclicker on the planet - Soni's Autoclicker aims to make automation powerful and
accessible to everyone.

Have you ever been in a situation where you needed to click fast, or click a lot at a given interval? Maybe you had to
press your keyboard too? This has got you covered. This autoclicker is powerful and easily accessible. Featuring native
builds for all major operating systems, the installation process is just a simple 'drag-n-drop'. To check it out for
yourself, head over to the [releases](https://github.com/soni801/autoclicker/releases) page.

The project is open source, meaning anyone can contribute to it. See anything you would like changed? Create an

for PRs. Read [the contributing guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before contributing.
